# StarAdmin

### The Why 

**StarAdmin** will be the name for the government in [Star City](https://github.com/WebDevBooster/star-city-manifesto). So, when referring to Star City's government we'll **NEVER use the word "government"** and always use the word *StarAdmin* instead. 

Why do we have to replace the word "government" with a different word when referring to **Star City's government**?

That's because the word "government" tends to leave a "bad taste" in people's mouth. Many people associate the word "government" with negative feelings and that perception is justified. In many countries, states and cities around the world the government tends to be corrupt, slow and inefficient.

In Star City, we aim to have the most transparent (and thus least corrupt), the fastest, the most efficient and the most democratic government in the world. 

Therefore, we MUST use a different word when referring to *our* government. Our government will be like NO OTHER government in the world. 

So, using a different word (free of negative emotions) will be super-important for our **branding** and the public perception of our government. Branding in general, will be one of the most important aspects for a successful development of Star City. That's why I named this city-state "Star City" in the first place. The powerful, positive branding starts with the name. 

**Naming is by far the most powerful and simultaneously the most overlooked sales booster in business and marketing.** And we need to sell people on the idea that *our* government is better than that of their home country. 

The name StarAdmin shall also serve as a constant inspiration and a reminder for people working in this department. It shall inspire them to rise above mediocrity, rise to their top performance and remind them of our mission. 

### The How

The word "admin" is short for administration in this case. But we **don't** want to use the word "administration". That word *feels dry* and it also feels *very slow*. 

So, NEVER use the word "administration" or even the word "admin" when referring to Star City's government. 

Always use the word **StarAdmin** instead. 

NEVER abbreviate the word StarAdmin. 

Always spell out *StarAdmin* completely. 

It's possible that other people (outsiders) might abbreviate StarAdmin but we must NEVER do that. 

Always capitalize both the "S" and the "A" in StarAdmin. 

StarAdmin is not just a word, it's a NAME. The name for Star City's government. So, don't ever spell it as "staradmin" or "Staradmin". Always capitalize *both* the "S" and the "A".
